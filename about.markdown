I began my career as a testing specialist at Nokia, where a strong eye for detail and early strength in risk identification quickly became the areas of interest for my work. From there, career evolved across software development projects of varying size and complexity, requiring adaptability, curiosity, and a readiness to take on multiple roles.

For nearly two decades, I have worked at the intersection of software development, quality engineering, AI, and automation, helping organizations build reliable and intelligent solutions that balance innovation with robustness.

I thrive on synthesizing knowledge across domains, bridging technical and business perspectives, and combining analytical thinking with creative problem-solving. My experience spans multiple industries, organizations, cultures, and languages.
