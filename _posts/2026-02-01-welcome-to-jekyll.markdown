## Background

I recently designed and built an expense‑tracker application as part of my ongoing work in QA engineering and AI‑assisted development. The project started as a personal challenge: create a clean, intuitive tool for managing expenses while also exploring how AI can meaningfully support software quality. What began as a simple idea quickly evolved into a full end‑to‑end build, combining product thinking, engineering, and experimentation with modern AI workflows.

## Approach

My goal was to treat this project as both a product and a learning environment. I architected the application with clarity and maintainability in mind, then integrated AI to generate structured, scenario‑based test cases. Instead of relying solely on manual QA processes, I used AI to simulate edge cases, user flows, and failure conditions that might otherwise be overlooked. This hybrid approach allowed me to validate the app’s logic, improve reliability, and demonstrate how AI can elevate traditional QA practices.

## Results
The final application is a lightweight, user‑friendly expense tracker supported by a robust suite of AI‑generated test cases. The testing process surfaced issues early, strengthened the codebase, and showcased how AI can accelerate quality assurance without sacrificing depth. This project has become one of my favorite examples of blending engineering, product design, and AI‑driven testing into a single cohesive workflow.

## Next Steps
Building on this momentum, I’m now incorporating the same AI‑assisted testing techniques into my upcoming tutorial, Creating GitHub Portfolios. The expense‑tracker app will serve as a hands‑on example inside Codespaces, giving learners a practical demonstration of how to build, test, and present their work effectively. My goal is to help people showcase their skills with clarity, confidence, and modern development practices.
