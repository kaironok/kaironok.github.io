## testing with AI

> To see a preview of this project go to (address will come soon) and select the `index.html` file and then `go live` on the status bar.


## Background

I recently designed and built an expense‑tracker application as part of my ongoing work in QA engineering and AI‑assisted development. The project started as a personal challenge: create a clean, intuitive tool for managing expenses while also exploring how AI can meaningfully support software quality.
## Approach

My goal was to treat this project as both a product and a learning environment. I architected the application with clarity and maintainability in mind, then integrated AI to generate structured, scenario‑based test cases.
## Results
The final application is a lightweight, user‑friendly expense tracker supported by a robust suite of AI‑generated test cases. The testing process surfaced issues early, strengthened the codebase, and showcased how AI can accelerate quality assurance without sacrificing depth. This project has become one of my favorite examples of blending engineering, product design, and AI‑driven testing into a single cohesive workflow.

## Next Steps
Building on this momentum, I’m now incorporating the same AI‑assisted testing techniques into my upcoming tutorial, Creating GitHub Portfolios. The expense‑tracker app will serve as a hands‑on example inside Codespaces, giving learners a practical demonstration of how to build, test, and present their work effectively. My goal is to help people showcase their skills with clarity, confidence, and modern development practices.
