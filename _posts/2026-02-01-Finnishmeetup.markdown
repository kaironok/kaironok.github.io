## Finnish Testing Meetup in Helsinki, Finland 
> [here](https://www.meetup.com/finland-testing-meetup-group/)

## About the event

The event was a great opportunity to meet people and take part in discussions. I contributed to the program by sharing insights and actively participating in conversations about testing practices, challenges, and innovation. The event also featured a competition for the Best Tester of the Year, highlighting excellence within the field.

## Key takeaways

The event was both inspiring and insightful. The presentations and discussions strengthened connections within the community, and reinforced the importance of continuous learning and quality in testing.

## Next steps

I’m taking these insights and ideas forward into my own work and future collaborations. Events like this show how strong and motivated the testing community is, and I’m already looking forward to continuing these discussions and participating in future testing events.

## Action point: ✨ Voting for Best Tester soon to be open! ✨
