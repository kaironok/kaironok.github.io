## Finnish Testing Meetup in Helsinki, Finland

> You can find group [here](https://www.meetup.com/finland-testing-meetup-group/)

## About participation

Last meetup was a great opportunity to meet people and take part in discussions. I contributed to the program by sharing insights and actively participating in conversations about testing practices, challenges and innovation. The event also featured a competition for the Best Tester of the Year, highlighting excellence within the field.

## Key takeaways

The presentations and discussions strengthened connections within the community and reinforced the importance of continuous learning and quality in testing.

## Next steps

Excited (and a little challenged) for an upcoming talk at Testing Community 🎤  

The topic is still evolving, but it will focus on Quality Assurance saturated by AI and how we, as testing professionals, can navigate this shift thoughtfully and strategically.

I’ll be grounding the presentation in established theoretical foundations (drawing from ISTQB certification-based QA frameworks) while also exploring the broader context of how AI is reshaping our roles, skills and mindset. Right now, I’m in the process of compiling and structuring everything into a coherent story.

To make sure the message is clear, we scheduled a rehearsal next Friday with friends and former colleagues.

I’m also experimenting with something: integrating “digital twin” AI-generated videos into the presentation — including versions of me speaking in different languages and explaining concepts from multiple angles. It’s both a demonstration of the technology and a reflection on how it’s influencing our professional landscape.

Still shaping the final direction, but the journey of building this talk is already pushing me to think deeper about quality, responsibility and the future of our craft.
