## Background

Yesterday, I attended a Finnish testing event that brought together professionals from across the testing community. The event combined networking, knowledge sharing, and a strong focus on the future of software testing.

## Action

During the day, we had the opportunity to meet many people from the industry and take part in several internal presentations. I also participated in the conference program by giving presentations and contributing to discussions around testing practices, challenges, and innovation. In addition, the event highlighted a competition for the Best Tester of the Year, celebrating excellence within the field.

## Result

The event was both inspiring and insightful. The presentations and discussions sparked valuable conversations, strengthened connections within the community, and reinforced the importance of continuous learning and quality in testing.

## Next

I’m taking these insights and ideas forward into my own work and future collaborations. Events like this show how strong and motivated the testing community is, and I’m already looking forward to continuing these discussions and participating in future testing events.

## Action point: Voting for Best Tester soon to be open!
