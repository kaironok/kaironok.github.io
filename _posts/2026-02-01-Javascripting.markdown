## Background
I came across a story from Leigh about building an app for LinkedIn Learning.  

## Javascript Card Game
The project is a simple card game built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The game involves shuffling a deck of cards and displaying them on the screen. The main features include:
- A deck of cards represented as an array of objects, each with a suit and value.
- A shuffle function that randomizes the order of the cards in the deck.
- A display function that renders the shuffled cards on the webpage.
