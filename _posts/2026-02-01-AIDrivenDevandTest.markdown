## testing with AI

> Demo solution I worked on, using Cursor and Codex AI. 

Expense tracker application is built with the prompt:
Build me an expense tracker application, where the expenses have the properties
"name", "amount", and "category". The application should be a simple terminal-
based app, and should use a CSV file as a database where expenses are
automatically saved to and loaded from.


## Instruction for running the application
1. Open Codespace
Select Expence_tracker.py file and run it.
2. Run the application


## Instruction for running the tests

## Test Results


## Next Steps
Building on this momentum, I’m now incorporating the same AI‑assisted testing techniques into my upcoming tutorial, Creating GitHub Portfolios. The expense‑tracker app will serve as a hands‑on example inside Codespaces, giving learners a practical demonstration of how to build, test, and present their work effectively. My goal is to help people showcase their skills with clarity, confidence, and modern development practices.
